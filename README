SambaPosix is a tool to manage POSIX attributes for
users and groups in a Samba4 based AD DC.

ATTENTION: The state of development is not even alpha.
At the current stage it helped setting up my own DC.
Documentation is restricted to what argparse produces.
I hope to improve this in future.

Please send bugs and ideas to debian@lhanke.de

1) What it can do
-----------------

SambaPosix can set POSIX attributes to users and groups,
as well as removing them again.

It can also list, which attributes are set and whether
conflicting settings exist. This comes in very handy
while setting up winbind, libnss-ldap, nslcd, etc. What
SambaPosix tells you, is actually in the LDAP!

SambaPosix can convert base64 encoded SID as returned
e.g. by ldapsearch to human readable form and vice
versa.

It can address groups by SID / RID and show SID
given POSIX names or numbers.

The tool can also add or remove users from groups.

It can bind to the AD DC using Kerberos, or TLS
protected using name and password. TLS can be disabled.

2) What it cannot do
--------------------

SambaPosix can not create users or groups, nor
delete those. Use samba-tool for that purpose.

SambaPosix may use, but does not work on Kerberos. So
use passwd or samba-tool to work on passwords.

3) Examples
-----------

# POSIXify user test
./SambaPosix.py user set test -u 1000 --gecos "Test User" --home "/home/test" --shell "/bin/bash"

# POSIXify group toast
./SambaPosix.py group set toast -g 1000

# add user test to group toast
./SambaPosix.py group add toast test

# show id information about user test
./SambaPosix.py user id test

# show getent information about group toast
./SambaPosix.py group getent toast

# show complete getent passwd from LDAP
./SambaPosix.py user getent

# don't use Kerberos, but authenticate as Administrator
./SambaPosix.py -U Administrator group getent

# unposixify group toast as Administrator
./SambaPosix.py -U Administrator group set toast --unposix
